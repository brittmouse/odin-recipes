		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>If you're looking for a burger recipe that you can make for any vegetarian friends or family members you have, or if you just want to experiment, black bean patties are a surprisingly tasty way to go! This recipe was taken from another cookbook found at my workplace and I have not tested it, but the idea is pretty simple. Makes 6 patties.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup dry black beans</li>
			<li>1 cup farro</li>
			<li>6 cups water</li>
			<li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 egg</li>
			<li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1.2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
			<li>6 hamburger buns</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Materials</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Cutting board</li>
			<li>Knives</li>
			<li>Instant Pot</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Combine beans, farro, and water in the Instant Pot. Close lid and cook for 25 minutes.</li>
			<li>Place drained beans and farro in a bowl with onion, garlic, egg, breadcrumps, salt, and pepper. Mash together until well-combined. Shape mixture into patties.</li>
			<li>Wipe out the Instant Pot and set to Saute mode. Add oil. Cook the patties in batches until well-browned on both sides. Serve of buns with your choice of condimenta.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>While this recipe uses the Instant Pot, you can do this using normal pots and skillets on a stove. Don't be afraid to experiment!</p>
